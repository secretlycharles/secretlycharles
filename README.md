## Hello! 👋 I'm Charles 🙂
I'm currently a college student residing in the United States with a dream of building incredible software anywhere. I have built intuitive software from the ground up, whether it be the frontend, backend, infrastructure, or security.

## 🧠What do I currently do?
I’m currently studying Computer Science while continuing to break, build, and analyze complex software systems. On the side, I enjoy working out, experimenting with startups, and occasionally, sleeping. Check out my projects below and feel free to connect with me!

## 🚀Projects
- 🛠️ [antibot.re](https://antibot.re/) — a research blog dedicated to reverse engineering modern anti-bot systems and more.
